                <p>Regalo del Dios or “Gift of God” was anything but that before Marcos arrived. The gang violence and lack of education was a huge problem in the area. Kids in the area had a very hard time finding ways to learn or grow.</p>
                <p class="quote">You won’t find Regalo de Dios on any tourist maps of Medellin. As a matter of fact, most Medellin residents have never been to this part of town since it has a reputation for being quite dangerous.</p>

                <p>Marcos realized this when he visited Regalo del Dios for the first time and knew he had to do something. Thus the Angeles de Medellin were born. The Angeles de Medellin have attracted over 3000 volunteers from all over the world to help enrich the lives of the families in the area.</p>
                <p>Marcos’s vision was to create a community center that empowered the town's people – specifically its children. He saw the value in creating a safe, happy space for them to do what they so often can’t do at home: play, have fun, and be kids.</p>
                <p>The Angeles de Medellin are able to help the extremely poor families by providing them with food, clothing and medicine in addition to an education. The families in the area have a safe place to go, free from the worries and problems that are so common in that area. The Angeles de Medellin are truly a “Gift of God”.</p>
